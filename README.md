Mine Pokemon is developed using React and Vite.js. The application is supported by AOS (Animation On Scroll), react-debounce-input, and SASS.

To handle the large volume of data, lazy loading is implemented, making the loading process more manageable. The search feature utilizes react-debounce-input to introduce delays, preventing lag and unnecessary API calls.
